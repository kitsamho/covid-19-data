Here you will find all the different scripts and tools that we use to generate [the
data](https://github.com/owid/covid-19-data/tree/master/public/data). 

Currently, most of the  pipelines have been integrated into our [`cowidev`](src/cowidev) library. For details about the
library structure and guidelines to contribute please refer to the [library documentation](docs/README.md).


## Folders
|Folder|Description                  |
|------|-----------------------------|
|[`docs/`](docs)|Development documentation.|
|[`grapher/`](grapher)|Hosts internal files that power our [_grapher_](https://ourworldindata.org/owid-grapher) visualizations.|
|[`input/`](input)|External files used to compute derived metrics, such as X-per capita, and aggregate groups, such as 'Asia', etc.|
|[`output/`](output)|Temporary files. Only for development purposes. Use it at your own risk.|
|[`src/cowidev/`](src/cowidev)|`cowidev` library. It contains the code for almost all project's pipelines.|
|[`scripts`](scripts)|Legacy folder. Contains some parts of the code, such as the COVID-19 testing collection scripts. The code is a mixture of R and Python scripts.|

Note that the folder [public/data](../public/data) is not to be modified, as it contains output files generated by this
pipeline.

## Library `cowidev`
Install it by runing `pip install .` from this directory. 

Currently it contains the code for the following data pipelines:

- Excess mortality
- Google Mobility
- OxCGRT
- Variants
- Vaccination
- YouGov

## Vaccination data
> 📁 Find it at [`scripts/vaccinations/`](scripts/vaccinations)

It is pobably the most mature and complex process. It has a submodule in the `cowidev` library that provides all the
tools to run all country importers. 

_More info:_
   - [Vaccination data overview](scripts/docs/VACCINATION_README.md)
   - [Vaccination data contribution guideline](scripts/docs/VACCINATION_CONTRIBUTE.md)

## Test data
> 📁 Find it at [`scripts/testing/`](scripts/testing)

It resembles very much the architecture of the vaccination pipeline, but differs in some key points. The most noticeable
difference is that it contains both R and python code. We currently prefer contributions in Python.

   - [Testing data contribution guideline](scripts/testing/CONTRIBUTE.md)

## Excess Mortality data
> 📁 Find it at [`cowidev.excess_mortality`](src/cowidev/excess_mortality/)

Collects excess [mortality data](https://github.com/owid/owid-datasets/tree/master/datasets/Excess%20Mortality%20Data%20%E2%80%93%20OWID%20(2021))
and exports it to human-readable format.

_Run it:_

```
python -m cowidev.excess_mortality etl
```

## YouGov
> 📁 Find it at [`cowidev.yougov`](src/cowidev/yougov/)

_Run it:_

```
python -m cowidev.yougov
```

## Others
> 📁 Find them at [`scripts/`](scripts/)
